# Attention Boost: <i>Time Management Application</i>
Time management can be a challenge for individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, with the right tools and strategies, it is possible to overcome these difficulties and effectively manage time. In this project, we will explore the use of Python programming to develop a time management tool for individuals with ADHD.<br><br>
The tool will include features such as task prioritization, deadline reminders, and progress tracking. These features will help individuals with ADHD stay organized, stay on track, and meet their deadlines. Additionally, the tool will be customizable, allowing users to personalize their experience to best suit their individual needs.<br><br>
The project will provide a practical solution for individuals with ADHD to manage their time more effectively, while also serving as a learning opportunity to explore the capabilities of Python programming. The project is a great opportunity to put into practice what you have learned in Python, while contributing to a valuable cause.
